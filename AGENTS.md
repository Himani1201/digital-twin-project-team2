# Agent Instructions

This file defines how AI agents should operate within the **digital-twin-project-team2** repository.

---



## Core Rules

* Do not modify files unless explicitly instructed
* Prefer documentation, clarity, and correctness over speed
* Make small, well-scoped changes** only
* Follow existing repository structure and naming conventions
* Do not introduce new tools, libraries, or frameworks without team approval

---

## Repository Scope (Current Phase)

Agents should focus on:

* Planning and design documentation
* Clear explanation of system architecture and workflow
* Conceptual design of RAG pipelines and AI agents
* Readable Markdown documentation

Agents should not:

* Implement full production code unless requested
* Add unnecessary boilerplate or premature optimisation
* Refactor unrelated content

---

## Coding & Design Guidelines (When Code Is Added)

* Keep code modular and easy to understand
* Prefer explicit logic over complex abstractions
* Use meaningful variable and function names
* Comment code to explain why, not just what

---

## AI & RAG Design Expectations

When discussing or designing AI components:

* Clearly separate:

  * Data storage (e.g. digitaltwin.json)
  * Retrieval (semantic/vector search)
  * Generation (LLM responses)
* Explain assumptions and limitations
* Avoid making claims of guaranteed accuracy
* Treat generated responses as assistive, not authoritative

---

## Security & Ethics

* Assume professional profile data may be sensitive
* Do not include real personal data in examples
* Avoid hard-coded secrets or credentials
* Follow basic ethical AI principles (transparency, user control, bias awareness)

---

## Collaboration & Version Control

* Respect team-based workflows (commits, pull requests, reviews)
* Do not rewrite history or squash commits unless instructed
* Keep commit messages clear and descriptive

---

## Documentation Standards

* Use clear headings and structured Markdown
* Keep explanations concise and student-friendly
* Update documentation when behaviour or design changes

---

## Read-Only / Caution Files

Unless explicitly instructed, treat the following as read-only:

* README.md (major changes require team agreement)
* Any agreed planning or assessment documents

---

## Out of Scope

Agents should not:

* Make architectural decisions without team context
* Add assessment-specific content without alignment to project requirements
* Introduce production-level security or scaling assumptions

---

**Guiding Principle:**

> Support the team by improving clarity, learning outcomes, and design quality while respecting collaborative project workflows.
